  const prompt = `You are a business analyst for Mylene's Boutique, a Philippine clothing rental shop (gowns, suits, barongs, Filipiniana, costumes). Write a clear, professional business performance report using ONLY the data provided below.

FORMATTING RULES (critical):
- Output PLAIN TEXT. Do NOT use any markdown: no # headings, no ** bold, no - or * bullets, no backticks, no numbered markdown.
- Use these exact plain section headers, each on its own line with no symbols:
  Executive Summary
  Key Performance Indicators
  Revenue Analysis
  Inventory & Utilization
  Operational Health
  Demand Forecast
  Recommendations
- Keep section headers as plain text exactly as written above.
- Put each distinct point on its own line so the report reads as clear, separated lines (not one run-on block).

LENGTH RULES:
- Write a CONCISE but COMPLETE report that fits on a SINGLE A4 page. Be focused and avoid filler, but include the real detail per section: a short paragraph or 2-3 bullet points each. Do not pad, and do not truncate important findings.

CONTENT RULES:
- Use only the numbers in the provided JSON. Do NOT invent, estimate, extrapolate, or alter any figure.
- All currency is Philippine Peso (₱). Report amounts exactly as given: if a value is below 1,000,000, write it in thousands (e.g., ₱60.3K), never as millions. Never use "M" unless the figure is truly ≥ 1,000,000.
- Do NOT contradict yourself. If a category appears in revenue leaders or most-rented items, do not call it "underperforming".
- "Underperforming" items are ONLY those listed in the underperforming array.
- Lead each section with the key takeaway, then support it with the relevant numbers.
- Recommendations: number them sequentially starting at 1 (1., 2., 3., ...) with no gaps, each a concrete action on its own line.

SECTION GUIDANCE (use the supplied data):
- Executive Summary: overall health (revenue direction, utilization, urgent risks) in a short paragraph.
- Key Performance Indicators: headline KPI numbers (active rentals, overdue, returned, cancelled, damaged, monthly revenue, utilization rate, overdue rate).
- Revenue Analysis: revenue by category and by month, plus top revenue-generating items.
- Inventory & Utilization: total/available/in-use items, utilization rate, most-rented items, underperforming items.
- Operational Health: overdue returns and late rate, damaged items, cancellation rate — each as its own line.
- Demand Forecast: projected rental-volume trend from the forecast (SMA/period values only).
- Recommendations: the prioritized action list.

KPIs: ${JSON.stringify(data.kpis)}
